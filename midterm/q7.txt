MIDTERM TEST QUESTION 7
(File systems and the real world: 2 marks)

In the paper "Fixing Unix/Linux/POSIX Filenames: Control Characters 
(such as Newline), Leading Dashes, and Other Problems" (2020 version, see paper.pdf provided),
 Wheeler describes various flaws and security loopholes that modern filesystems exhibit.


Task A)  

Pick 1 of these flaws/security loopholes and describe why the filesystem you 
implemented for A1 also exhibits the flaws/weaknesses/security loophole
 that you chose to discuss from the paper. 

	Note: I did not submit my A1 assignment due to personal reasons so my answer is based on a hypothetical implementation.
	A major flaw that my assignment would have had was the ability for the user to choose any file name. Without any parsing for the filenames the user
	could abuse malicious behavior which is a security issue. For example as described in the paper a file named "-n" could cause problems such as when 
	being used with GNU cat it will cause a numbured output. 
	

Task B) Pick 1 other of these flaws/security loopholes and describe how 
the filesystem you implemented for A1 does NOT(!!!) exhibit this 
flaw/weakness/security loophole. 

As mentioned in Section 6.2 of the paper, having leading and/or trailing spaces is a flaw in a lot of cases. So although not implemented my code would've
had a parsing loop to avoid having unneeded whitespace.
